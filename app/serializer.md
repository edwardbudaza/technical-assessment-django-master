# Serializer Documentation

In this document, we will explore the `serializer.py` file in detail. This file contains serializer classes responsible for converting complex data types, such as queryset instances and model instances, into native Python datatypes. It also handles deserialization, validating input data, and creating complex data structures.

- Fields:
  - id: The unique identifier of the camera group.

  - start_date: The start date of the status log.
  - end_date: The end date of the status log.
  - user: The user associated with the status log (serialized using UserSerializer).
